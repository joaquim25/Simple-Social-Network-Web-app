# Simple Social Network Web App
## Description
This web app is a simple social network app that allows users to sign up, log in, search for other users, follow/unfollow them, and publish posts with images and descriptions. It was developed as a project for the Eddisrupt Bootcamp.

The app primarily utilizes JavaScript to emulate React behavior and employs local storage for storing user data, including login information, followers, following, and posts.

## Features
- Sign up: Users can create a new account by providing their name, email, password, and a unique username (ID).
- Log in: Registered users can log in using their email and password.
- Search: Users can search for other users by entering their email address.
- Follow/Unfollow: Logged-in users can follow and unfollow other users.
- Publish Post: Logged-in users can publish posts with an image and a description.
- Profile Page: Each user has their own profile page displaying their information, posts, and followers/following.
- Logout: Users can log out of their account.
